"""
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

        s = s.strip()
        s = s.split()
        s = s[::-1]
        return " ".join(s)

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
s = "the sky is blue"
print(solution.reverseWords(s))  # Output: "blue is sky the"
